                <li>Add onion and garlic to the skillet at medium heat. Cook till softened and brown, about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Return the chicken to the pan, increase heat to high, and bring to a boil, then pour in the soy sauce and white vinegar, seasoning with garlic, black pepper, and a bay leaf.</li>
